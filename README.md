Mental health disorders impact millions globally, and early identification of symptoms is crucial in seeking appropriate support. This project focuses on developing an AI-driven Mental Health Severity Prediction System that classifies users into three categories: Mild, Moderate, and Severe.
System Overview: The core of the system is a machine learning model that evaluates users' mental health based on their inputs. Additionally, it incorporates a mental health chatbot, powered by Google Gemini, to provide users with explanations and coping mechanisms, ensuring a supportive and educational interaction.
User Interface: An interactive and user-friendly interface has been developed using Stream lit, enhancing the overall user experience and making the system accessible and easy to navigate
Technologies used:
1.	Python
2.	LLM â€“ Google Gemini 1.5 flash
3.	Scikit-learn
4.	Stream lit and Job lib
5.	Matplotlib and Seaborn
